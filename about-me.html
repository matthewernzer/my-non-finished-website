            My name is Matthew Stroude-Ernzer, I was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec. As a child I was always
            interested in and fascinated by money and business. As I grew older I slowly discovered various ways to make
            money. Ways that I could not even begin to imagine as a youth. The internet has expanded my knowledge
            exponentially, and gave me a realization that working a nine to five, every week, Monday to Friday, was not
            the only option out there. This was when I stared taking online research more seriously. I've learned a lot
            through different social media platforms, such as; Instagram, YouTube and Facebook. I've learned even more
            from Google through hundreds if not thousands of searches in my life time. Shortly after this I applied for
            the Social Media Applications and Marketing course in continuing education at Concordia University which I
            am currently attending. The purpose if this was to expand my knowledge even further and broaden my horizons
            in regards to advertising via social media. This is a crucial part of any business especially in this
            generation. Once I complete my course at Concordia I look forward in gaining experience in the field.
